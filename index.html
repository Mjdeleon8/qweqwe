                      Dissecting preserved frogs is a common way to learn about
                      the insides of animals and how their bodies work. It helps
                      us understand how animals adapted over time, like when
                      they moved from living in water to living on land

                      Dissection allows students to see, touch and explore the
                      various organs. Seeing organs and understanding how they
                      work within a single animal may strengthen studentsâ€™
                      comprehension of biological systems.

                    Dissecting frogs in school helps students learn about animal
                    bodies by doing it themselves. This hands-on experience
                    makes it easier to understand how animals are built inside.

                      Dissection is an activity where we aim to differentiate
                      parts of the body to understand its morphology.
